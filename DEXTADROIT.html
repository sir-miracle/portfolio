    I have ever loved technology, creativity and innovation.
Aside being an Electrical Engineer by profession, I have ventured into S.T.E.M (science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education,
 where several educational tools branching into robotics, animation and games development, coding, and electronics are used to promote Innovation, 
 creativity and problem-solving skills in young minds especially school children.
</p>
<p>
    And still, I once tried to pick up a “suitable ” programming language language to learn. 
    Shortly after, I discovered there are limitations - two most significant of them being not having a community 
    and not being able to know why one would want to learn a particular language, and not the other, even before starting out.
</p>
<p>
    When I came across the opportunity to join Decagon, I understudied the structure and system they presented, and it became clear that I needed them.
Well I am now a happy “Decadev”, SQ009, Android stack.
</p>
<p>
    The program is just shy of two weeks already, and the intensity is already burning.
     Imagine that my first task is to “model a Facebook console” where a user will be able to create an account, as an adult, admin or a child. 
     The user should be able to login, view posts, edit posts, delete posts and logout as well.
</p>
<p>
    The Decagon Experience, so far has been mixed! There is the fun, good people around, power supply, 
    good food, and then there is the need to aggressively attack studies in order to beat short deadlines!!.
Well, I have been a strong fellow before now, and I choose to believe what has been said, “Trust the process”
</p>
